It was necessary to write a program that creates a one-dimensional array with a size of 15 elements. After you need to fill in its contents using a random number generator, in the interval
from 0 to 99. Then the program must invert the array, by replacing the value of the first element to last, second to penultimate, etc. Print the source array and result
good performance. <br/><br/>

My array    : [81 87 47 59 81 18 25 40 56 0 94 11 62 89 28]<br/>
Invert array: [28 89 62 11 94 0 56 40 25 18 81 59 47 87 81]<br/>
